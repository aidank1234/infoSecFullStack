Hi! Thank you for using this full stack country lookup!

In order to start this application, the php server must be started.

Mac/Linux: open up the terminal application and type the following commands:
	
	cd path/to/countryLookup/folder
	php -S localhost:3000
	
Windows: download either XAMPP or WAMP and start a php server on localhost:3000

After the php server is started, open the index.html file in a web browser to start and use the application.
